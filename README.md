Welcome to GameHub.
GameHub is an app available for both iPhone and Android.
The GAMEHUB app is designed for gamers who are looking for new or old games.
It provides brief explanations and additional information about each game.
It is important to note that there is no purchasing option within the app.
Additionally, the app showcases upcoming games that are expected to be released soon.
The app also provides information on newly released games and any updates made to the app itself.

A brief guide to help you understand how to get the app to work:
1.First, you need to use a software called Visual Studio Code.
2.the latest version of Node.js installed.
3.Android Studio software to run the app itself, or if you have Expo on your phone, you can use that (it’s important to note that this is an app you need to download and it is free).
4.After downloading and installing everything on your computer, you need to open the folder in Visual Studio Code and then install the code in the Visual Studio terminal.
5.Now, you need to type the following two words in the terminal: npm install.
6.After everything has been updated and downloaded by the software, open Android Studio and download the appropriate phone emulator for your computer. I use an Android phone emulator named Pixel 4 API 27.

And all that's left to do is simply type the following two words in the Visual Studio terminal: npm start.
